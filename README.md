# serverless-api
API using Lambda and serverless

## Requirements

[Serverless.com](http://serveless.com)

## Setup

1. Treat each folder as a seperate node application.
2. In each service folder folder you must run `npm install`

## Caveats
1. Currently: any changes made in the global folder files must be manually copied to the service folders
2. Only the dev env is reflected at the moment.
